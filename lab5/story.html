		<h2>My Story</h2>
		<article>
			<h2>What motivated me to pursue in the field of Computer Science</h2>
			<p>I was very good at Math from a very young age and loved to solve problems.When I was 12 my dad bought a PC to our house, that was the very first time I encountered with a PC. Initially I used system just to play games and one day I thought how come when I press something on keyboard is reflecting on monitor. That made me very fascinated about computers. </p>
			<p>I began to investigate the tech world and learnt a great deal of little things.  In any case, I'm happy I'm doing this. It has turned into my enthusiasm and I'll seek after it as long as it takes.</p>
